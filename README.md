# Calculation of slope and intercept in simple linear regression


In this project, the value of slope and intercept for simple linear regression is calculated.

This function has two parameters x and y which are included in the following formulas.


*This formula calculates the slope value in simple linear regression*

`θ (slope) = Σ (x' * y') / Σ (x' ** 2)`

*This formula calculates the intercept value in simple linear regression*

`c (intercept) = ȳ - θx̄`
